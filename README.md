# Symphony Integration Script Overview  
The ability to automated geneos alert messages into your Symphony environment.

### Contents
- [Geneos Configuration](geneos/README.md)

#### Requirements
You must have python 2.7 or higher to install:

`$ python -V`

This script does depend on the requests module:

`$ pip install requests`

And finally you need to have the `webhook_url`, generated from your Symphony environment for messages to be directed.
